<script>
// wrapping somethign by Number() will convert it to a number

function multiply3(in) {
	return in * 3;
}
// we don't need to crreate a variable if we won't use it
alert('your number multiplied by 3 is :' + multiply(my_number));

// we can create another function to multiply by 4
function multiply4(in) { return in * 4; }
// those 2 functions are pretty similar , we can even make it more global
function multiply(nb1, nb2) { return nb1 * nb2; }
//we don't need to have 2 functions, e.g. to multiply my_number by 3 we just call multiply(my_number, 3).
// try it below
